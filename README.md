# Marathon Map üèÉüó∫Ô∏è

**A Flutter app I developed to track marathon completion progress across all 50 US states.**

---

## Project Overview

Marathon Map is a mobile app built with Flutter and Firebase that enables users to visualize and track their marathon achievements across the United States. The app features an interactive map where each completed state is marked with a checkmark, providing a clear and motivating overview of progress.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a cross-platform mobile application with real-time cloud data synchronization, interactive UI, and state management.
